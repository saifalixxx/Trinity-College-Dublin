  @   represent the integer as a decimal value in ASCII form, prefixed
  @   by the sign (+/-).
  @ The first character in R0 should represent the sign
  @ The second character in R1 should represent the most significaint digit
  @ The third character in R2 should represent the least significant digit
  @ Store 'N', '/', 'A' if the integer is outside the range -99 ... 0 ... +99
